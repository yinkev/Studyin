  "rationale_correct": "The patient's presentation of acute chest pain combined with ST-segment elevation (â‰¥ 2mm in V2-V3 for males > 40) in contiguous precordial leads (V2-V4) is the classic presentation for an anterior wall ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI).",
  "rationales_distractors": {
    "opt_a": "Pericarditis typically presents with diffuse, concave ST elevation across multiple territories, not localized to an anatomical distribution like this case.",
    "opt_c": "NSTEMI is characterized by ischemic symptoms and elevated cardiac biomarkers, but without significant ST-segment elevation on the ECG. It may present with ST depression or T-wave inversions.",
    "opt_d": "Unstable angina presents similarly but is distinguished by the absence of cardiac biomarker elevation, and it does not typically cause ST-segment elevation."
