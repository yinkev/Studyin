## Questions to Discuss

1. **Mastery Score Algorithm**: Confirm weights (30% first attempt, 20% overall, 30% retrieval, 20% materials)
2. **Knowledge Gap Thresholds**: What mastery score = critical/high/medium/low?
3. **Exam Readiness Model**: What features should we use for prediction?
4. **Spaced Repetition**: Use SM-2 algorithm or customize?
5. **Visualization Priorities**: Which analytics to build first?
