### 🔧 Recent Changes (This Session - 2025-10-11)

#### 1. Speed Controls Implementation

**Backend Changes:**

**`backend/app/services/codex_llm.py`** (Lines 36-332)
- Updated `DANGEROUS_SHELL_CHARS` regex to `r'[&|`$<>\\]'` (safe: `[]();`)
- Added `reasoning_effort` and `verbosity` parameters to `_build_safe_command()`
- Extended `generate_completion()` signature with new parameters
- Passes flags to Codex CLI: `--effort low|medium|high`, `--verbosity low|medium|high`

**`backend/app/api/chat.py`** (Lines 25-247)
- Extended `WebSocketMessage` TypedDict with `reasoning_effort` and `verbosity` fields
- Added validation (defaults to `low` and `medium` respectively)
- Passes parameters to `codex_llm.generate_completion()`

**Frontend Changes:**

**`frontend/src/hooks/useChatSession.ts`** (Lines 76-503)
- Added `reasoning_effort` and `verbosity` to `OutboundMessage` interface
- Created refs: `reasoningEffortRef` and `verbosityRef`
- Implemented setters: `setReasoningEffort()` and `setVerbosity()`
- Includes parameters in WebSocket payload

**`frontend/src/components/chat/ChatPanel.tsx`** (Lines 60-173)
- Added state: `reasoning` and `verbosity`
- Created dropdown controls with `<select>` elements
- Added `.chat-control-group` wrappers for better layout
- Synchronized state with parent hook via `useEffect`

**`frontend/src/index.css`** (Lines 446-538)
- Responsive grid layout for controls
- Custom styled dropdowns (`.chat-select`)
- Mobile-first with auto-fit grid columns
- Hover/focus states for better UX

#### 2. Prompt Sanitization Fix

**Issue:** Backend was blocking legitimate characters `[]` and `;` used in medical text and markdown.

**Fix:** Updated `DANGEROUS_SHELL_CHARS` regex to only block actual shell injection characters.
- **Before:** Blocked `[]();` (too aggressive)
- **After:** Only blocks `&|`$<>\\` (necessary for subprocess.exec safety)
- **Rationale:** Using `subprocess.exec` (not `shell=True`) means `[]();` are just data, not commands

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/app/services/codex_llm.py` (Lines 36-40)

#### 3. VISION.md Creation & Updates

**`VISION.md`** (347 lines)
- **Core Philosophy:** Adaptive Multi-Modal Teaching (NOT Socratic-only, NOT lectures)
- **Three Teaching Modes:** First Pass (active learning), Review (practice), Mastery (Socratic)
- **Competitive Reality:** Analysis of Amboss, UWorld, Anki, Osmosis
- **What's Coming:** AI chat will be commoditized in 6-12 months
- **Moat Features:**
  - Deep personalization (individual learning profiles)
  - Longitudinal relationship (mascot personality, 2+ year journey)
  - Adaptive multi-modal teaching (changes format per mastery level)
  - Fully dynamic (LLM-extracted topics, not hardcoded)
- **Why Someone Would Use This:** Learn from THEIR materials, prefer conversation, want personalization
- **Build Strategy:** Use MVP → collect data → adaptive modes → moat features
- **Key Principle:** DYNAMIC (LLM-generated), not hardcoded
- **Ultimate Vision:** Exam readiness engine ("You're 73% ready for Step 1")

## 🐛 Known Issues & Notes

### Issues

1. **First Token Delay (ADDRESSED)**
   - **Was:** GPT-5 taking 21.9s for first token with high reasoning
   - **Fix:** Added reasoning control with "low" default
   - **Status:** User should test and report new timings

2. **Prompt Sanitization (FIXED)**
   - **Was:** Blocking legitimate characters `[]` `;` in medical text
   - **Fix:** Updated regex to only block shell injection chars
   - **Status:** Resolved, backend auto-reloaded

3. **WebSocket Disconnect on Long Response**
   - **Description:** Client disconnects if GPT-5 takes too long (>35s before first token)
   - **Workaround:** Use Reasoning: Low to reduce latency
   - **Status:** Monitoring, may need timeout adjustment

### Notes

- **Codex CLI:** Uses OAuth, already authenticated
- **Gemini API:** FREE tier, generous quota
- **CSRF:** Disabled for MVP (line in main.py)
- **Auth:** Hardcoded user (no login required)
- **PostgreSQL:** Running on localhost:5432
- **ChromaDB:** Embedded mode (no server)
- **Speed Controls:** All validation server-side (defaults to safe values)

## 🔄 Next Steps

### Immediate: User Testing (HIGH PRIORITY)

1. **Test Speed Controls**
   - Record baseline timings for Reasoning Low/Medium/High
   - Test Verbosity Low/Medium/High combinations
   - Document which combination works best for your learning style
   - Report any issues or unexpected behavior

2. **Find Pain Points**
   - Use the app to actually study
   - Upload your anatomy/physiology PDFs
   - Ask real questions
   - Note what annoys you:
     - Is it too slow?
     - Is it too verbose?
     - Is Socratic method frustrating on first pass?
     - Are responses too shallow or too deep?

3. **Validate VISION.md**
   - Read through VISION.md
   - Confirm it matches your goals
   - Add/remove features as needed
   - Prioritize what to build next

### Phase 1: Data Collection (Weeks 3-4)

**Goal:** Start tracking everything to enable personalization

**What to Build:**
1. **Learning Events Table**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE learning_events (
       id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
       user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
       question TEXT,
       extracted_topics TEXT[],  -- LLM-extracted dynamically
       context_chunks_used UUID[],
       session_duration INTEGER,
       timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
   );
   ```

2. **Topic Extraction**
   - After each question, use LLM to extract topics
   - Store in `learning_events.extracted_topics`
   - Build dynamic topic list (NOT hardcoded)

3. **Basic Analytics Dashboard**
   - Topics studied + frequency
   - Last reviewed date
   - Session duration trends
   - Materials usage

**Why This Matters:**
- Can't build personalization without data
- Need YOUR actual usage patterns
- Foundation for spaced repetition and mastery tracking

### Phase 2: Adaptive Teaching Modes (Weeks 5-8)

**Goal:** Implement the 3 teaching modes from VISION.md

**What to Build:**
1. **Mastery Tracking**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE topic_mastery (
       user_id UUID,
       topic TEXT,
       exposure_count INTEGER,
       last_studied TIMESTAMP,
       confidence_level TEXT,  -- 'learning' | 'practicing' | 'mastered'
       PRIMARY KEY (user_id, topic)
   );
   ```

2. **Mode Selection Logic**
   - First Pass (0-2 exposures) → Active Learning mode
   - Review (3-5 exposures) → Deliberate Practice mode
   - Mastery (6+ exposures) → Clinical Reasoning mode
   - Backend automatically selects mode per topic

3. **Prompt Templates**
   - Active Learning: "Let's explore [topic] step by step. I'll guide you..."
   - Deliberate Practice: "Let's test your understanding. [Question with hints]"
   - Clinical Reasoning: "Here's a clinical scenario: [Pure Socratic]"

**Why This Matters:**
- Addresses "How can I answer Socratic questions when I don't know it yet?"
- Matches your learning style: interactive, iterative, scaffolded
- Makes the tool actually useful for first-pass learning

### Phase 3: The Moat (Months 3-6)

**Goal:** Build features that won't be commoditized

1. **Personal Learning Profile**
   - Track YOUR forgetting curves per topic
   - "You forget anatomy in 3 days, biochem in 1 day"
   - Personalized review schedules

2. **Mascot Personality**
   - Consistent companion (like Notion AI)
   - Remembers your journey
   - "You struggled with cardio in M1, crushed it in M2"

3. **Exam Readiness Predictor**
   - USMLE Step 1 content outline
   - "You've studied 8% of cardio (exam is 12%)"
   - "Predicted score: 230 based on current performance"

4. **Dynamic Knowledge Graphs**
   - LLM detects prerequisites
   - "You asked about heart failure but haven't studied cardiac cycle"
   - Suggests learning paths

**Why This Matters:**
- This is what differentiates you from Amboss/Anki/ChatGPT
- Switching cost: Years of data + emotional connection
- Can't be replicated by competitors in 6 months

## 🎓 Technical Decisions

### Why These Speed Controls?

**Reasoning Effort (low/medium/high):**
- **Low:** Fast responses for quick questions
- **Medium:** Balanced for most use cases
- **High:** Deep reasoning for complex topics
- **Default:** Low (optimize for speed)

**Verbosity (low/medium/high):**
- **Low:** Concise answers (bullet points)
- **Medium:** Balanced explanations
- **High:** Detailed with examples and context
- **Default:** Medium (readable but not overwhelming)

**Why Codex CLI Flags?**
- Native support for reasoning/verbosity control
- No manual prompt engineering needed
- Consistent behavior across models

### Why Gemini API?
- FREE tier with generous quota
- Good quality embeddings (text-embedding-004)
- No credit card required
- Easy to switch to paid tier later

### Why ChromaDB?
- Embedded mode (no server)
- Simple API for MVP
- Can migrate to pgvector later if needed
- Good for local development

### Why Codex CLI?
- OAuth-based (no API key management)
- Already installed and authenticated
- Supports streaming
- Multiple models (gpt-5, claude, etc.)

### Why Hardcoded User?
- MVP speed (skip auth complexity)
- Easier testing
- Focus on core features first
- Can add proper auth in Phase 4

### Why Dynamic (Not Hardcoded)?
- Medical content changes frequently
- User has custom materials (not USMLE textbooks)
- LLM can extract topics from ANY content
- No maintenance burden (no topic lists to update)

## 💡 Key Insights from This Session

### Learning Style Discovery
- **User:** "I don't know how I learn best right now. Interactive and iterative. Lectures go over my brain."
- **Key Question:** "How can I answer Socratic questions when I don't even know it?"
- **Solution:** Adaptive Multi-Modal Teaching (NOT Socratic-only on first pass)

### Competitive Positioning
- **What's Commoditized:** AI chat, basic RAG will be everywhere in 6-12 months
- **What's Defensible:** Personal learning profiles, longitudinal relationships, fully dynamic system
- **Why This Matters:** Focus on moat features, not tech that will be commoditized

### Build Strategy
- **NOW:** Use MVP, find pain points (don't over-engineer)
- **NEXT:** Data collection (track everything)
- **THEN:** Adaptive modes (based on YOUR data)
- **AFTER:** Moat features (personalization, exam readiness)

### Speed Optimization
- **Problem:** GPT-5 taking 21.9s for first token
- **Solution:** Reasoning control with "low" default
- **Expected:** Significant reduction in latency
- **Next:** User documents actual timings
