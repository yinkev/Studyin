## üß† Option D: Neural Network Visualization

**Status:** Saved for Phase 2
**Use Case:** Knowledge map/pattern visualization
**When to implement:** After Hybrid core is complete

### Features to Build:

- [ ] "Synaptic strength" calculation algorithm
- [ ] Zoom to explore dense topic areas

### Technical Requirements:
- Three.js or D3.js for advanced visualization
- WebGL for smooth animations (optional)
- Color gradients: Purple ‚Üí Cyan ‚Üí Green
- Particle effects for neural firing
- Calculate connection strength from study history

### Algorithm Ideas:
```javascript
// Connection Strength = f(recency, frequency, accuracy)
connectionStrength = (
  0.4 * recency_score +      // Last practiced
  0.3 * frequency_score +    // How often practiced
  0.3 * accuracy_score       // Correct answer rate
)
```

## üèÜ Option E: Achievement Vault

**Status:** Saved for Phase 3
**Use Case:** Gamification layer on top of any design
**When to implement:** After core functionality is stable

### Features to Build:
- [ ] Achievement definition system (JSON config)
- [ ] Progress tracking per achievement
- [ ] Unlock animations (toast notifications)
- [ ] Rarity tiers (Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum)
- [ ] "Gamerscore" calculation
- [ ] Achievement showcase (profile page)
- [ ] Steam-style achievement pop-ups

### Achievement Categories:
```javascript
const achievementTypes = {
  STREAK: 'Study streaks (3, 7, 30, 100 days)',
  ACCURACY: 'Perfect scores (5, 10, 25, 50 in a row)',
  VOLUME: 'Questions answered (100, 500, 1000, 5000)',
  SPEED: 'Fast answers (<10s, <5s, <3s)',
  MASTERY: 'Topics mastered (10, 25, 50, 100)',
  EXPLORATION: 'Try all topics, use all features',
  PERFECT: 'Perfect week, perfect month',
  DEDICATION: 'Late night study, early bird study'
};
```

### Technical Requirements:
- Achievement state management (Zustand or Context)
- LocalStorage persistence
- Toast notification library (Sonner)
- Icon library (Lucide or custom SVGs)
- Animation library for unlock effects

## üé® Design System Compatibility

All designs use the same INFJ-centered theme system:

### Colors (Shared):
```css
--accent-trust: #22d3ee (Cyan)
--accent-mastery: #a78bfa (Purple)
--accent-analysis: #34d399 (Green)
--success: #34d399
--warning: #fbbf24
--error: #f87171
```

### Typography (Shared):
```css
--font-heading: Inter (Skill Tree, Achievement Vault)
--font-body: System UI (all)
--font-mono: JetBrains Mono (Mission Control, Laboratory)
```

### Components to Reuse:
- `DataCard` - All designs
- `StatDisplay` - Mission Control, Laboratory
- `MetricRow` - All designs
- Theme toggle - All designs

## üîÑ Integration Strategy

### How to Layer These Designs:

1. **Base Layer:** Hybrid (Mission Control layout)
2. **Add:** Neural Network as dedicated page/modal
3. **Add:** Achievement system as overlay (toasts, side panel)
4. **Add:** Skill Tree as alternate view (toggle in left panel)
5. **Add:** Laboratory theme for Analytics page

### View Switching:
```
Header Tabs:
[Mission View] [Skill Tree] [Neural Map] [Achievements] [Lab Reports]
```

Or keep Hybrid as base and add others as features.

## üí° Quick Implementation Notes

**Fastest to Add:**
1. Achievement Vault (just UI + state management)
2. Skill Tree (if data structure exists)

**Most Complex:**
1. Neural Network (requires WebGL/advanced viz)
2. Laboratory theme (requires new analytics backend)

**Best ROI:**
1. Achievement Vault (immediate engagement boost)
2. Skill Tree (clear progression visualization)
