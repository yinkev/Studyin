# IMPLEMENTATION BLUEPRINT: Phase 1 MVP - Personal Learning Companion

## 1. Overview
This document provides the detailed technical specifications for building the Phase 1 MVP. The goal is to create a local-first application that transforms user-uploaded documents into interactive lessons and provides personalized study recommendations.

Another agent will follow these instructions to implement the features. All work should be confined to the local environment, with no reliance on cloud services.

---

## 2. Data Schemas

The following JSON schemas will be central to the application. They should be defined in a shared location (e.g., `core/types/mvp.ts`).

### InteractiveLesson
This is the structure for the lessons generated by the AI Tutor.

```json
{
  "id": "unique_lesson_id",
  "sourceFile": "path/to/original/file.pdf",
  "tags": ["Cardiology", "Pharmacology"],
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "heading",
      "level": 1,
      "text": "Introduction to Beta-Blockers"
    },
    {
      "type": "text_block",
      "text": "Beta-blockers are a class of medications that are predominantly used to manage cardiovascular diseases..."
    },
    {
      "type": "multiple_choice_question",
      "id": "unique_question_id_1",
      "learningObjective": "LO-001",
      "stem": "What is the primary mechanism of action for beta-blockers?",
      "choices": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "Blocking beta-adrenergic receptors" },
        { "id": "b", "text": "Enhancing sodium channel function" },
        { "id": "c", "text": "Inhibiting ACE" }
      ],
      "correctChoice": "a"
    }
  ]
}
```

### LearnerState
This structure will be used to save the user's progress. It will be stored in a local JSON file at `data/state/local-user.json`.

```json
{
  "userId": "local-user",
  "knowledgeState": {
    "LO-001": {
      "ability": 0.6,
      "stability": 15.5,
      "lastAnsweredTimestamp": "2025-10-07T10:00:00Z",
      "history": [
        { "questionId": "unique_question_id_1", "isCorrect": true, "confidence": "High" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## 3. File Ingestion Workflow (The AI Tutor)

This workflow covers the process from file upload to lesson creation.

### 3.1. UI Components

1.  **`/upload` Page:**
    - A simple page with a file input field allowing the user to select a document from their local machine.
    - An "Upload and Process" button to initiate the workflow.

2.  **Tag Confirmation Modal:**
    - After the AI processing is complete, a modal window will appear.
    - It will display a list of AI-suggested tags in editable input fields or pills.
    - It will include an "Add Tag" button and "Save Lesson" button.

3.  **File/Lesson Management View:**
    - A new view (e.g., a sidebar or a dedicated `/library` page) that lists all lessons.
    - Each entry should show the lesson title/tags and provide a button to study it or delete it.

### 3.2. AI Processing Logic

- When the user clicks "Upload and Process", the application will execute a local CLI command using the `clink` tool.
- The UI should display a simple "Processing..." message while the command runs.
- **Command to execute:**
  ```bash
  clink gemini -r planner -f "/path/to/uploaded/file.pdf" --prompt "/path/to/prompt.txt"
  ```
- The output of this command is expected to be a JSON string matching the `InteractiveLesson` schema.

### 3.3. AI Tutor Prompt

The application will generate a temporary text file (`/path/to/prompt.txt`) to pass to the `clink` command. This prompt will contain the following instructions:

```text
You are an expert instructional designer and medical educator. Your task is to transform the provided document into a structured, interactive lesson. Follow these steps precisely:

1.  **Analyze Document:** Read the entire document to understand its key concepts and learning objectives (LOs).

2.  **Web Research:** For each key concept, perform a web search to find high-quality, supplementary information, examples, and clarifications. The original document is the ground truth; you must not contradict its core facts. Use web search only to enrich the content.

3.  **Generate Tags:** Based on your analysis, generate an array of 3-5 relevant string tags for this lesson. The tags should range from broad (e.g., "Cardiology") to specific (e.g., "Beta-Blockers").

4.  **Generate Lesson Content:** Create an array of content blocks. The lesson should be structured logically for learning. You can use the following block types:
    - `heading`: With `level` (1-3) and `text`.
    - `text_block`: With `text` content.
    - `multiple_choice_question`: With a unique `id`, `learningObjective`, `stem`, an array of `choices`, and the `correctChoice` id.

5.  **Output:** Your final output must be a single, valid JSON object conforming to the `InteractiveLesson` schema. Do not include any other text or explanation in your output.
```

## 4. Study Experience Workflow (The Personalization Coach)

This workflow covers the user's interaction with the lessons.

### 4.1. UI Components

1.  **Main Study Page (`/study`):
    - **Coach's Suggestion:** A prominent section at the top of the page should display the lesson the Coach recommends studying next, with a "Start Studying" button.
    - **Manual Mode:** A separate section, clearly labeled "My Library" or "Manual Study," which allows the user to browse all lessons by tag or title and select one to study freely.

2.  **Interactive Lesson Viewer:**
    - This component will render the `content` array from the `InteractiveLesson` JSON.
    - It will display headings and text blocks. When it encounters a question block, it will render the question and choices.
    - After the user answers a question, it should display the correctness and then a **Confidence-Rating component** (e.g., three buttons: "High," "Medium," "Low").

### 4.2. Personalization Logic

- The **Personalization Coach** will be a TypeScript module that runs in the browser.
- **Suggestion Algorithm:** On page load, it will read the `LearnerState` from `data/state/local-user.json`. It will calculate a score for each Learning Objective based on a simple formula (e.g., `score = ability * time_since_last_answered`) and suggest the lesson containing the LO with the highest score.
- **State Update:** When a user answers a question and rates their confidence, the application will update the corresponding LO in the `LearnerState` object and re-save the `local-user.json` file.

---

## 5. Error Handling

- If a queue job fails (status `failed`) or the worker produces invalid lesson JSON, the UI shows: **"Processing failed. Please try again."** and retains the error string for inspection in the Activity list.

> Archived plan moved to `docs/archive/IMPLEMENTATION_HISTORY.md`.
> 
> Consensus Deltas (2025-10-06)
> - Confirm server action integration: keep `app/study/actions.ts` as the single entry for attempts/reviews; no new route needed beyond `/api/attempts` and `/api/search`.
> - Add optional `engine` metadata to attempt/session events (schema v1.1.0) and propagate through `services/telemetry/*` and `lib/server/events.ts` without breaking analyzer.
> - Keep shims (`lib/engine/shims/**`) as the only runtime import surface for `scripts/lib/*.mjs`.
> - Add dynamic module picker in Study UI to detect banks under `content/banks/**` and scope dashboards/scheduler/retention to the selected module. Merge base blueprint with optional `config/blueprint-dev.json` in dev to include new LOs.
> - `/upload` dev-only flow: gated by `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_UPLOAD=1`; jobs enqueue to the local queue; `scripts/worker.ts` processes them deterministically. Generated content must pass the validator before inclusion.
> 
> ## Overview
> This plan translates the authoritative spec in `docs/personal-adaptive-study-engine-spec.md` into concrete, testable work. We will implement Rasch/GPCM with Elo fallback, a Thompson Sampling cross‑topic scheduler, and an FSRS‑based retention lane, all deterministic and gated by blueprint rails and exposure caps. We will wire telemetry using `scripts/lib/schema.mjs` and surface transparent reasons in the UI.
> 
> ## Architecture
> - Ability & Scoring
>   - `scripts/lib/rasch.mjs`: Rasch 1‑PL utilities, Gauss–Hermite nodes/weights (41‑point), EAP posterior computation, information function `I(θ)`.
>   - `scripts/lib/gpcm.mjs`: GPCM PMF/log‑likelihood and category thresholds `τ` handling; EM re‑fit scaffold for weekly job.
>   - `scripts/lib/elo.mjs`: Reuse for cold‑start; add helpers to map Elo R↔Rasch θ (θ = (R−1500)/400) and blend with Rasch.
> - Selector & Scheduler
>   - `scripts/lib/selector.mjs`: In‑LO candidate scorer implementing utility `U = [I(θ̂|b,τ)/median_time] * multipliers` and randomesque K‑of‑N pick.
>   - `scripts/lib/scheduler.mjs`: Thompson Sampling over LO arms for expected `ΔSE/min`, urgency multiplier, and blueprint rail multipliers; cooldown enforcement.
> - Retention Lane
>   - `scripts/lib/fsrs.mjs`: FSRS parameter updates and next review scheduling; overdue boosts; time budgeting to ≤40% baseline, ≤60% when overdue >7d.
> - Balancing & Exposure
>   - `scripts/lib/exposure.mjs`: Item exposure ledger (≤1/day, ≤2/week, 96h cooldown), multiplier curve (0→0.5→1.0), and partial‑credit overfamiliarity clamp.
>   - `scripts/lib/blueprint.mjs`: Reuse; add functions to compute drift and multipliers per LO/system (±5% rails with clamps).
> - Telemetry & Analytics
>   - Use `AttemptEvent` and `SessionEvent` from `scripts/lib/schema.mjs:103`–`138` for training/retention/scheduler events; enrich with engine fields via an `engine` property under `metadata`.
>   - Analyzer remains in `scripts/lib/analyzer-core.mjs`; extend summary with exposure/blueprint drift counters if needed (non‑breaking, bump `ANALYTICS_SCHEMA_VERSION` at `scripts/lib/analyzer-core.mjs:4`).
> - Learner State & Actions
>   - `lib/study-engine.ts`: shared adaptive helpers (Rasch ability, scheduler arms, retention budgeting, “Why this next”).
>   - `lib/study-insights.ts`: compute dashboards (priority/stalled LOs, overexposed items) from learner state + analytics.
>   - `lib/server/study-state.ts`: file-backed learner state store (`data/state/<learner>.json`, override via `STUDY_STATE_DIR`).
>   - `app/study/actions.ts`: server action to update learner state, append telemetry, and return refreshed signals to the client.
> 
> ## Data Model
> - Per‑learner state: LO‑level `θ̂`, `SE`, last probe `b` window flag, and item‑level response counts; persisted in app storage (server‑side JSON under `data/state/<user>.json`) for local dev; optional Supabase tables later.
> - Exposure ledger: per item/user timestamps for day/week counts and cooldown unlock times.
> - Retention cards: FSRS parameters per item+LO; next review timestamps.
> 
> ## File‑by‑File Changes (execution order)
> 1. `scripts/lib/rasch.mjs` — GH nodes/weights, EAP posterior, info function, mastery probability.
> 2. `scripts/lib/gpcm.mjs` — PMF/log‑likelihood, thresholds `τ`, EM re‑fit scaffold and shrinkage hooks.
> 3. `scripts/lib/selector.mjs` — Utility computation, filters (time cap ≤6 min; exposure), randomesque top‑K.
> 4. `scripts/lib/scheduler.mjs` — TS over LO arms with urgency and blueprint multipliers; cooldown logic.
> 5. `scripts/lib/fsrs.mjs` — FSRS updates, scheduling, budgeted queue filler.
> 6. `scripts/lib/exposure.mjs` — Ledger, multipliers, overfamiliarity clamp.
> 7. `lib/server/study-state.ts` — Persist learner LO ability + item exposure counts (JSON with cooldown history).
> 8. `lib/study-engine.ts` — Export shared helpers (difficulty→β, Thompson arms, retention budgeting, “Why this next”).
> 9. `app/study/actions.ts` — Server action handling Rasch update, telemetry append, learner state persistence.
> 10. `app/study/engine.ts` — Server module orchestrating selection loop; integrates telemetry writers using schemas and re-exports shared helpers.
> 11. `components/StudyView.tsx` — Client view invoking the server action, rendering “Why this next,” and respecting recommended LO queue.
> 12. `scripts/jobs/refit-weekly.mjs` — Weekly Rasch/GPCM refit summary (`npm run jobs:refit`); emits per-item stats (attempt totals, p-value, suggested half-life) under `data/refit-summaries/` for governance review.
> 13. Docs: update `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `PLAN.md` with engine gates and operations.
> 
> ## Interfaces & Contracts
> - Inference loop API (internal):
>   - `selectNext({ learnerId, loId, sessionState }) -> { itemId, reason, signals }` using `selector.mjs`.
>   - `scheduleNextLo({ learnerId, eligibleLos, blueprint }) -> { loId, reason, signals }` using `scheduler.mjs`.
>   - `retentionQueue({ learnerId, sessionMinutes }) -> Array<{ itemId, dueAt }>` using `fsrs.mjs`.
> - Telemetry
>   - Reuse existing ingestion endpoints: `POST /api/attempts`, `POST /api/sessions`; keep deterministic writers; NDJSON path in `scripts/analyze.mjs:10`.
> 
> ## Tests (unit/e2e/perf)
> - `tests/rasch.eap.test.mjs` — EAP update monotonicity and convergence on synthetic item responses.
> - `tests/gpcm.pmf.test.mjs` — PMF sums to 1; log‑likelihood increases under correct updates.
> - `tests/scheduler.ts.test` — TS prioritizes LOs with higher sampled `ΔSE/min`, respects rails and cooldowns.
> - `tests/exposure.ledger.test.mjs` — Caps enforced (≤1/day, ≤2/week) and cooldown transitions.
> - `tests/fsrs.queue.test.mjs` — Budgeted fill obeys ≤40%/≤60% rule and overdue boosts.
> - `tests/engine.state.test.ts` — Learner state persistence roundtrips, exposure counters, JSON shape.
> - UI snapshot for “Why this next” pill shows numeric components and matches engine signals.
> 
> ## Observability & Ops
> - Add structured `console.debug` with `{ engine: 'selector|scheduler|fsrs', reason, signals }` in server logs.
> - Weekly job logs EM fit status and reliability deltas; bump `ANALYTICS_SCHEMA_VERSION` only on additive fields (`scripts/lib/analyzer-core.mjs:4`).
> - Analytics dashboard includes a reliability card (KR-20 + low point-biserial items) to highlight content needing review.
> 
> ## Security & Privacy
> - No PII in state files; key by pseudonymous learner IDs.
> - Keep service‑role secrets server‑only; reuse existing envs in `.env.example`.
> 
> ## Acceptance Gates (from PRD)
> - Blueprint rails within ±5%; exposure caps enforced; stop rules met; randomesque top‑K; retention budgeting.
>  - Deterministic outputs; evidence P95 <250 ms.
> - Validator clean; analytics present and deterministic; PLAN updated post‑merge.
> 
> ## Rollout & Backout
> - Branch: `feat/adaptive-engine`.
> - Rollout in phases (selector → scheduler → retention → weekly EM fit), feature‑flagged behind `ENGINE_ENABLE=1` in server modules.
> - Backout: disable the flag and fall back to current static Study/Drill ordering; keep attempt ingestion untouched.
> 
> ## Risk Register
> | Risk | Owner | Status | Mitigation |
> | --- | --- | --- | --- |
> | Rasch/EAP numerical instability | AnalyticsEngineer | Open | Clamp θ grid, log‑sum‑exp stabilization, unit tests.
> | Cold‑start quality | AnalyticsEngineer | Open | Elo fallback and blended warm step; sanity bounds.
> | Scheduler overfocus on long LOs | Implementation Strategist | Open | Use per‑minute objective and blueprint multipliers; cap utility.
> | Overexposure | QA‑Proctor | Open | Strict caps and cooldown enforcement; ledger tests.
> | Weekly EM maintenance load | ProjectManager | Open | Automate job with logs and guardrails; only adjust when reliability improves.

> # Feature — “Why This Next” Pill · Implementation Plan (Scoped)
> 
> Date: 2025-10-02
> Owners: UIBuilder, GraphUX, AnalyticsEngineer
> 
> ## 1) Architecture (deterministic, UI-only)
> - Data source: `public/analytics/latest.json` read on server via `lib/getAnalytics.ts`.
>   - Output path contract: `scripts/analyze.mjs:10–11`; generator: `scripts/analyze.mjs:13–19`.
>   - Field contract: `scripts/lib/analyzer-core.mjs:278–299` (summary root), `:194–201` (confusion_edges), `:189–193` (elg_per_min), `:146–162` (ttm_per_lo).
> - Signals formatter: `lib/study-engine.ts:220–248` (`buildWhyThisNext`), reused by the pill.
> - Placement: Study screen header next to the existing Why toggle in `components/StudyView.tsx:352–405`.
> - Rendering: Small client component that receives deterministic props (numbers) and renders pill with no network calls.
> 
> ## 2) Interfaces
> ```ts
> // components/pills/WhyThisNextPill.tsx (new)
> export interface WhySignals {
>   info: number; blueprintMult: number; exposureMult: number; fatigue: number;
>   medianSec: number; thetaHat: number; se: number; masteryProb: number;
>   loIds: string[]; itemId: string;
> }
> export function WhyThisNextPill(props: { signals: WhySignals; onClick?: () => void }): JSX.Element
> ```
> 
> ## 3) Data flow
> 1) Server loads analytics once per request in `app/study/page.tsx` via `loadAnalyticsSummary()` (see `lib/getAnalytics.ts:1–24`).
> 2) `StudyTabs` → `StudyView` receives `analytics` prop (see `app/study/page.tsx:1–22, 30–44`).
> 3) `StudyView` derives per-item candidate signals using helpers:
>    - derive ability: `components/StudyView.tsx:64–93` and `lib/study-engine.ts:246–261`.
>    - score candidates: `lib/study-engine.ts:51–92`.
>    - compose rationale: `lib/study-engine.ts:220–248`.
> 4) Pass structured numbers to the pill component (no string concatenation in the UI); pill renders compact chips with a simple tooltip.
> 
> ## 4) File‑by‑File Changes
> 1. `components/pills/WhyThisNextPill.tsx` — NEW: render compact pill with numeric chips (Info, Blueprint×, Exposure×, Median s, θ̂, SE, Mastery).
> 2. `components/StudyView.tsx` — REF: replace inline string `whyNext` display with `<WhyThisNextPill signals={…} />` keeping the existing popover (lines `352–405`).
> 3. `tests/why-pill.test.tsx` — NEW: unit render test verifying chips render and numbers are formatted deterministically; snapshot minimal.
> 4. `tests/engine.why.test.ts` — KEEP/ADOPT: already validates `buildWhyThisNext` composition (present in repo, add to test run).
> 5. `README.md` — DOC: add short usage note for the pill and analytics dependency.
> 
> ## 5) Tests (unit/e2e/perf)
> - Unit: `tests/why-pill.test.tsx` ensures all chips present and formatted; `tests/engine.why.test.ts` already covers string builder.
> - Integration: add Study view render smoke with mocked analytics to ensure pill mounts.
> - Perf: ensure render <1ms in jsdom by limiting chip count and using memoized formatting.
> 
> ## 6) Observability
> - Add `data-why-next` attributes to chips for test selectors.
> - Optional `console.debug` in dev builds gated by `NODE_ENV!=='production'`.
> 
> ## 7) Security/Privacy
> - Read‑only local JSON; no PII; no network calls; no runtime LLM.
> 
> ## 8) Performance
> - Focus on render speed and stability in this phase.
> - No layout shift: fixed-size inline pill; clamp to 2 lines in existing popover.
> 
> ## 9) Rollout & Backout
> - Feature‑flag via boolean prop on `StudyView` (default ON). Backout by rendering the prior inline string.
> 
> ## 10) Owners & Timeline
> - Day 0: component + tests (UIBuilder, GraphUX).
> - Day 1: integrate into `StudyView`, add snapshot and smoke test; PM updates PLAN.
> 
> ## 11) Risks
> - Risk: analytics missing → show ghost pill with “Analytics unavailable”.
> - Risk: overlong numbers → format with fixed decimals and max-width chips.
> 
> ## 12) Acceptance Gates (must pass)
> - Deterministic: no runtime fetch beyond local JSON; snapshot stable.
> - Tests green; validator unaffected; CI build required by branch protection stays green.
> - PLAN updated after merge.
