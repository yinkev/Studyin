# Archive Index

This directory contains archived documentation and prototype pages that are no longer active but kept for reference.

## Archived Documentation

### Planning Documents
- **IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Original implementation guide (superseded by MASTER_PLAN_UIUX.md)
- **PLAN.md** - Initial project planning (superseded by PRD.md)
- **HANDOFF.md** - Legacy handoff documentation

### Historical Records
- **IMPLEMENTATION_HISTORY.md** - Implementation history log
- **README_HISTORY.md** - README changelog

## Archived Prototype Pages

Location: `/app/_prototypes/`

These prototype pages were created during UI/UX exploration and are now archived. Next.js ignores directories starting with underscore, so these won't be accessible in production.

### Navigation Prototypes
- **dashboard-nova/** - Alternative dashboard design (replaced by /dashboard with HeroUI)
- **nova/** - Study interface prototype
- **nova-dark/** - Dark theme variant
- **nova-toggle/** - Theme toggle variant
- **nova-improved/** - Enhanced variant

### Design Exploration
- **design-options/** - General design explorations
- **playful-options/** - Playful theme variants
- **monochrome-variations/** - Monochrome theme experiments

## Active Documentation

For current documentation, see:
- [README.md](../README.md) - Quick start and overview
- [MASTER_PLAN_UIUX.md](../MASTER_PLAN_UIUX.md) - Current UI/UX roadmap
- [PRD.md](../PRD.md) - Product requirements
- [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) - Release history
- [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) - Agent documentation
- [gemini.md](../gemini.md) - Gemini integration

## Why Archive?

These files and pages were valuable during development but are no longer needed for active work:

1. **Planning docs** - Superseded by more comprehensive documentation
2. **Prototype pages** - Completed exploration; production implementations are live
3. **Historical records** - Preserved for reference but not actively maintained
