## 🎨 Design System Integration

Seamlessly matches your **Soft Kawaii Brutalist Minimal Pixelated** design:

- ✅ Soft UI cards with neomorphic shadows

- ✅ Kawaii emoji icons (📊 📈 🗓️ 🎓 🏆)
- ✅ Brutalist typography for headers
- ✅ Gentle animations with `ease-soft-bounce`
- ✅ Color palette from design tokens
- ✅ Responsive grid layouts

**Visual Examples:**
- **Primary Purple** (`hsl(247, 90%, 66%)`) for XP trends
- **Blush Pink** (`hsl(332, 78%, 72%)`) for daily XP bars
- **Mint Green** (`hsl(158, 66%, 68%)`) for achievements
- **Soft gradients** on cards and charts
- **Pixel borders** on all containers

---

## 🔌 API Integration

Frontend expects **4 backend endpoints**:

### 1. Learning Overview
```http
GET /api/analytics/learning/overview
```
Returns: 30-day metrics (sessions, minutes, accuracy, materials)

### 2. Activity Heatmap
```http
GET /api/analytics/learning/heatmap
```
Returns: 90 days of daily activity (sessions, minutes, XP)

### 3. Gamification Progress
```http
GET /api/analytics/gamification/progress
```
Returns: XP trend (30 days), achievements, level, total XP

### 4. Event Tracking
```http
POST /api/analytics/events
```

## 🚀 How to Test

### Option 1: Dev Server (Now)
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:5173
# Click "Analytics" in nav bar
```

**Expected:** Loading spinner → Error (backend not ready) → Retry button

### Option 2: With Mock Data
Add mock endpoints to backend (see `/ANALYTICS_QUICK_START.md`) or use axios-mock-adapter in frontend.

**Expected:** Beautiful dashboard with charts and data!

### Option 3: Full Integration
Implement backend API endpoints → Test end-to-end → Deploy!

## 📈 Analytics Events Being Tracked

The frontend now tracks:

### Session Events
- **Session start** - When chat WebSocket connects
- **Session end** - When chat component unmounts (with duration)

### Material Events
- **Material view** - When user clicks a material card in Dashboard
- **Material upload** - When user uploads new material

### Chat Events
- **Chat message** - When user sends a message (tracks length)
- **Chat response** - When AI responds (tracks latency)

### Gamification Events
- **XP earned** - When user gains XP (with source)
- **Achievement unlocked** - When achievement is earned
- **Level up** - When user reaches new level
- **Streak milestone** - When user hits streak goals

### Navigation Events
- **Page navigation** - When user switches views

**All events are debounced and fail silently to protect UX.**
