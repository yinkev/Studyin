## 2. Prompt Engineering Best Practices

### Research-Validated Prompt Structure

Based on analysis of 6+ studies generating NBME-style questions:

#### Core Prompt Components

1. **Persona Adoption** (Improves quality by ~10%)
   ```
   "You are a medical educator developing USMLE Step 1 examination questions
   for the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME)."
   ```

2. **Specific Task Definition**
   ```
   "Generate [N] multiple-choice questions that:
   - Test clinical reasoning and knowledge application (not recall)
   - Follow NBME item writing guidelines
   - Use patient-centered vignettes
   - Include realistic clinical scenarios"
   ```

3. **Content Grounding** (RAG Integration)
   ```
   "Base questions on the following medical content:
   [RAG-retrieved chunks from user's study materials]
   ```

4. **Format Specification**
   ```
   "Format each question as:
   - Clinical vignette (2-4 sentences)
   - Question stem (specific, focused)
   - 4-5 options (one correct, others plausible but wrong)
   - Explanation (why correct answer is right, why others are wrong)"
   ```

5. **Quality Criteria**
   ```
   "Ensure questions:
   - Avoid bias (gender, race, socioeconomic)
   - Use patient-centered language
   - Test application/analysis (Bloom's levels 3-4)
   - Have only ONE unambiguously correct answer
   - Include realistic distractors based on common errors"
   ```

### NBME-Compliant Clinical Vignette Structure

**Standard USMLE Format:**
```
[Patient demographics] + [Chief complaint] + [History] + [Physical exam] +
[Lab findings] + [Question stem] + [Options A-E]
```

**Example Template:**
```
"A 68-year-old man with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus
comes to the emergency department because of crushing substernal chest pain
for 2 hours. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 105/min, respirations
are 22/min, and blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg. Physical examination shows
diaphoresis and bilateral lung crackles. An ECG shows ST-segment elevation in
leads II, III, and aVF. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

A) Acute myocardial infarction (correct)
B) Pulmonary embolism
C) Aortic dissection
D) Unstable angina
E) Pericarditis"
```

### Recommended Prompt Template

```python
NBME_QUESTION_PROMPT = """You are a medical educator developing USMLE Step 1 examination questions for the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME).

Your task: Generate {num_questions} high-quality multiple-choice questions based on the medical content provided below.

    "bloom_level": 3,
    "topic": "Topic name from content",
    "subtopic": "Specific subtopic"
  }}
]

## 3. Distractor Generation Strategies

### Research-Based Approaches

#### 1. Knowledge Graph-Guided Generation (MOST EFFECTIVE)

**Approach:**
- Build medical knowledge graph from authoritative sources (UMLS, SNOMED-CT)
- Identify semantically similar but incorrect concepts
- Generate distractors that are "close but wrong"

**Example:**
- Correct: "Acute myocardial infarction"
- Good distractors: "Unstable angina" (similar presentation), "Pulmonary embolism" (chest pain), "Aortic dissection" (acute chest pain)
- Poor distractors: "Pneumonia" (not related to acute chest pain), "Appendicitis" (completely wrong body system)

**Implementation for MVP:**
```python
# Simple semantic similarity without full knowledge graph
async def generate_distractors(
    correct_answer: str,
    context: str,
    num_distractors: int = 3
) -> List[str]:
    """
    Generate plausible distractors using semantic similarity.

    In Phase 5, enhance with medical knowledge graph for better clinical plausibility.
    """
    prompt = f"""Given this correct answer: "{correct_answer}"

    Medical context: {context}

    Generate {num_distractors} plausible but incorrect alternatives that:
    1. Are semantically related to the correct answer
    2. Represent common student misconceptions
    3. Are in the same category (e.g., all diagnoses, all treatments)
    4. Could be confused with correct answer by someone who partially understands

    Return JSON array of distractor strings."""

    # Use GPT-5 to generate distractors
    response = await codex_llm.generate_completion(
        prompt=prompt,
        profile="studyin_fast",  # Fast model for distractor generation
        temperature=0.8,  # Higher temperature for diversity
    )
    return parse_distractors(response)
```

#### 2. Misconception-Based Distractors

**Strategy:**
- Generate distractors based on common student errors
- Use incorrect reasoning paths that seem logical
- Include "close but not quite" answers

**Prompt Addition:**
```
"For each distractor, base it on a common misconception:
- Distractor 1: Related condition with similar presentation
- Distractor 2: Same category but wrong mechanism
- Distractor 3: Treatment for similar but different condition
- Distractor 4: Correct concept but wrong clinical context"
```

#### 3. Difficulty-Calibrated Distractors

**Easy questions (difficulty 1-2):**
- Distractors from completely different categories
- Obviously wrong to someone with basic knowledge

**Medium questions (difficulty 3 - NBME standard):**
- Distractors from same category but clearly distinguishable
- Requires understanding of key differences

**Hard questions (difficulty 4-5):**
- Distractors that differ by subtle clinical features
- Requires deep understanding and clinical reasoning

---

## 4. Quality Control & Validation

### Automated Validation Pipeline

#### Step 1: Structural Validation
```python
async def validate_question_structure(question: Dict) -> Tuple[bool, List[str]]:
    """
    Validate basic question structure and format.

    Returns: (is_valid, list_of_issues)
    """
    issues = []

    # Required fields
    required_fields = ["question", "options", "correct_index", "explanation"]
    for field in required_fields:
        if field not in question:
            issues.append(f"Missing required field: {field}")

    # Options validation
    if len(question.get("options", [])) < 4:
        issues.append("Must have at least 4 options")

    # Correct index validation
    correct_idx = question.get("correct_index", -1)
    if correct_idx < 0 or correct_idx >= len(question.get("options", [])):
        issues.append("Invalid correct_index")

    # Vignette length (NBME typical: 50-200 words)
    question_text = question.get("question", "")
    word_count = len(question_text.split())
    if word_count < 20:
        issues.append("Clinical vignette too short (< 20 words)")
    elif word_count > 300:
        issues.append("Clinical vignette too long (> 300 words)")

    return len(issues) == 0, issues
```

#### Step 2: Medical Accuracy Check
```python
async def validate_medical_accuracy(question: Dict, rag_context: str) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
    """
    Use GPT-5 to validate medical accuracy and clinical plausibility.
    """
    validation_prompt = f"""You are a medical education quality reviewer.

2. Distractor plausibility (wrong answers are plausible but incorrect)
3. Clinical realism (scenario could occur in real practice)
4. Factual consistency with provided content
5. No ambiguity (only one correct answer)

Respond with JSON:
{{
    "is_valid": true/false,
    "accuracy_score": 0-10,
    "issues": ["list of any issues"],
    "suggestions": ["list of improvements"]
}}
"""

    # Use fast model for validation
    response = await codex_llm.generate_completion(
        prompt=validation_prompt,
        profile="studyin_fast",
        temperature=0.0,  # Low temperature for consistent validation
    )

    result = parse_validation_response(response)
    return result["is_valid"], result
```

#### Step 3: Bloom's Taxonomy Classification
```python
async def classify_bloom_level(question: Dict) -> int:
    """
    Automatically classify question cognitive level using Bloom's taxonomy.

    Returns: 1-6 (Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create)
    """
    classification_prompt = f"""Classify this medical question's cognitive level using Bloom's taxonomy:

QUESTION: {question['question']}

Bloom's Taxonomy Levels:
1. Remember: Recall facts (e.g., "What is the normal heart rate?")
2. Understand: Explain concepts (e.g., "Explain the cardiac cycle")
3. Apply: Use knowledge in new situations (e.g., "Which treatment for this patient?")
4. Analyze: Break down and examine (e.g., "Analyze these lab findings")
5. Evaluate: Make judgments (e.g., "Evaluate diagnostic approaches")
6. Create: Synthesize new solutions (rare in MCQ)

NBME Step 1 targets levels 3-4 (Apply/Analyze).

Return JSON: {{"bloom_level": 1-6, "reasoning": "brief explanation"}}
"""

    response = await codex_llm.generate_completion(
        prompt=classification_prompt,
        profile="studyin_fast",
        temperature=0.0,
    )

    result = parse_classification(response)
    return result["bloom_level"]
```

#### Step 4: Bias Detection
```python
def detect_bias(question: Dict) -> Tuple[bool, List[str]]:
    """
    Detect potential bias in question wording.

    NBME guidelines require bias-free, patient-centered language.
    """
    issues = []
    text = question["question"].lower()

    # Gender bias patterns
    gender_biased_terms = ["he", "she", "his", "her", "him"]
    if any(term in text for term in gender_biased_terms):
        # Check if it's part of clinical vignette (acceptable) vs. question stem (not acceptable)
        if text.count("he") + text.count("she") > 2:
            issues.append("Consider using gender-neutral language where possible")

    # Racial/ethnic bias
    unnecessary_demographics = ["race", "ethnicity", "religion"]
    if any(term in text for term in unnecessary_demographics):

    biased_descriptors = ["poor", "wealthy", "homeless", "affluent"]
    if any(term in text for term in biased_descriptors):
        issues.append("Avoid socioeconomic descriptors unless clinically necessary")

    # Stigmatizing language
    stigmatizing_terms = ["alcoholic", "drug abuser", "obese patient"]
    preferred_terms = ["patient with alcohol use disorder", "patient with substance use disorder", "patient with obesity"]
    for i, term in enumerate(stigmatizing_terms):
        if term in text:
            issues.append(f"Replace '{term}' with '{preferred_terms[i]}'")

    return len(issues) == 0, issues
```

### Quality Scoring Rubric

Based on research showing 78% of AI-generated questions rated "High Quality":

```python
@dataclass
class QuestionQualityScore:
    """Comprehensive quality assessment for generated questions."""

    # Structural validity (0-10)
    structure_score: int  # Has all required fields, proper format

    # Medical accuracy (0-10)
    accuracy_score: int  # Correct answer is right, distractors are wrong

    # Clinical realism (0-10)
    realism_score: int  # Scenario is plausible, could occur in practice

    # Bloom's taxonomy match (0-10)
    bloom_score: int  # Matches intended cognitive level

    # Distractor quality (0-10)
    distractor_score: int  # Plausible but clearly incorrect

    # Bias-free language (0-10)
    bias_score: int  # Patient-centered, no unnecessary demographics

    # Overall grade
    @property
    def overall_score(self) -> float:
        """Weighted average: 70/100+ is "High Quality"."""
        weights = {
            "structure": 0.15,
            "accuracy": 0.30,  # Most important
            "realism": 0.20,
            "bloom": 0.15,
            "distractor": 0.15,
            "bias": 0.05,
        }
        return (
            self.structure_score * weights["structure"] +
            self.accuracy_score * weights["accuracy"] +
            self.realism_score * weights["realism"] +
            self.bloom_score * weights["bloom"] +
            self.distractor_score * weights["distractor"] +
            self.bias_score * weights["bias"]
        )

    @property
    def quality_rating(self) -> str:
        """Human-readable quality rating."""
        score = self.overall_score
        if score >= 85:
            return "Excellent - Ready to use"
        elif score >= 70:
            return "High Quality - Minor edits needed"
        elif score >= 55:
            return "Acceptable - Moderate edits needed"
        else:
            return "Poor Quality - Major revision required"
```

### Human-in-the-Loop Workflow

Based on research consensus that **human expert review is essential**:

```python
@dataclass
class QuestionReviewStatus:
    """Track question review state."""

    question_id: uuid.UUID
    status: str  # "generated", "pending_review", "approved", "rejected", "needs_revision"
    generated_at: datetime
    reviewed_at: Optional[datetime]
    reviewer_notes: str
    revision_count: int
    automated_score: float

    # Review flags
    medical_accuracy_confirmed: bool
    clinical_realism_confirmed: bool
    distractor_quality_confirmed: bool
    bias_check_passed: bool
```

**MVP Review Workflow:**
1. Auto-generate questions with quality scores
2. **High quality (85+)**: Mark for light review
3. **Acceptable (70-84)**: Mark for standard review
4. **Poor (<70)**: Auto-reject or mark for heavy revision
5. Human reviewer approves/rejects/requests edits
6. Approved questions added to question bank

**Phase 5 Enhancement:**
- Track reviewer feedback to improve prompt templates
- Build feedback loop: Learn from rejections to improve generation
- A/B test: Compare GPT-5 vs. GPT-5-mini vs. Claude for question quality

## 6. Production Implementation Patterns

### Batch Generation vs On-Demand

#### On-Demand Generation (Recommended for MVP)

**When to use:**
- User requests questions on specific topic
- Immediate feedback needed
- Personalized difficulty based on user level
- RAG context varies per user

**Implementation:**
```python
async def generate_questions_on_demand(
    user_id: uuid.UUID,
    topic: str,
    difficulty: int,
    num_questions: int = 5,
    session: AsyncSession = None,
) -> List[Dict]:
    """
    Generate questions on-demand based on user's study materials.

    Performance: 30-60 seconds for 5 questions
    Cost: ~$0.04-0.08 per generation (with caching)
    """
    # 1. RAG retrieval: Get relevant context from user's materials
    rag_context = await retrieve_user_context(user_id, topic, session)

    # 2. Generate questions with GPT-5
    questions = await codex_llm.generate_questions(
        topic=topic,
        difficulty=difficulty,
        num_questions=num_questions,
        context=rag_context,
        profile="studyin_study",  # Balanced model for quality + speed
    )

    # 3. Automated quality validation
    validated_questions = []
    for q in questions:
        is_valid, quality_score = await validate_question(q, rag_context)
        if is_valid and quality_score.overall_score >= 70:
            validated_questions.append({**q, "quality_score": quality_score})

    # 4. If not enough high-quality questions, regenerate poor ones
    if len(validated_questions) < num_questions:
        additional = await regenerate_failed_questions(
            topic, difficulty, num_questions - len(validated_questions), rag_context
        )
        validated_questions.extend(additional)

    return validated_questions
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Fresh, personalized questions
- ✅ Based on user's actual study materials
- ✅ Adaptive difficulty
- ✅ Immediate generation

**Cons:**
- ❌ 30-60 second wait time
- ❌ Higher per-question cost
- ❌ No pre-validation by experts

#### Batch Generation (Phase 5 Enhancement)

**When to use:**
- Pre-generate question banks for common topics
- Expert review before making available
- Cost optimization for frequently-requested topics
- Creating standardized assessment sets

**Implementation:**
```python
async def batch_generate_question_bank(
    topics: List[str],
    difficulty_levels: List[int],
    questions_per_topic: int = 20,
) -> Dict[str, List[Dict]]:
    """
    Pre-generate question bank for common topics.

    Performance: 5-10 minutes for 100 questions
    Cost: ~$0.20-0.30 for 100 questions (with batch API discount)
    """
    # Use Batch API for 50% cost savings
    batch_requests = []
    for topic in topics:
        for difficulty in difficulty_levels:
            batch_requests.append({
                "topic": topic,
                "difficulty": difficulty,
                "num_questions": questions_per_topic,
            })

    # Process batch with prompt caching
    results = await codex_llm.batch_generate(
        requests=batch_requests,
        use_batch_api=True,  # 50% discount
        enable_caching=True,  # 90% discount on cached portions
    )

    # Validate and store in database
    question_bank = {}
    for result in results:
        topic = result["topic"]
        questions = result["questions"]

        # Automated validation
        validated = [q for q in questions if validate_structure(q)[0]]

        # Store for expert review
        await store_for_review(validated, topic=topic)

        question_bank[topic] = validated

    return question_bank
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ 50% cost savings with Batch API
- ✅ Pre-validated by experts
- ✅ Instant delivery to users
- ✅ Higher quality control

**Cons:**
- ❌ Not personalized to user's materials
- ❌ Requires manual curation
- ❌ Storage overhead
- ❌ May not cover niche topics

### Recommended Hybrid Approach

```python
class QuestionGenerationStrategy:
    """Intelligent strategy for question generation."""

    async def generate(
        self,
        user_id: uuid.UUID,

        cached_questions = await self.get_cached_questions(

```

### Caching Strategies

#### 1. Prompt Caching (90% cost reduction)

**How it works:**
- GPT-5 caches recent input tokens
- Reuse cached prompt template + instructions
- Only pay full price for new RAG context

**Implementation:**
```python
# Base prompt (cached for 5 minutes)
BASE_PROMPT = """You are a medical educator developing USMLE questions...
[Full prompt template - 500 tokens]
"""

# Per-request (new context)
async def generate_with_caching(topic: str, context: str):
    # This gets cached after first use
    prompt = BASE_PROMPT

    # This changes per request (not cached)
    prompt += f"\n\nCONTENT:\n{context}\n\nGenerate questions about {topic}:"

    response = await codex_llm.generate_completion(prompt)
    return response

# First call: Pay full price ($0.0035)
# Subsequent calls within 5 min: Pay only for context (~$0.0005)
```

#### 2. Response Caching (Database)

**Store generated questions with metadata:**
```python
@dataclass
class CachedQuestion:
    id: uuid.UUID
    topic: str
    subtopic: str
    difficulty: int
    bloom_level: int
    question_text: str
    options: List[str]
    correct_index: int
    explanation: str
    quality_score: float
    expert_reviewed: bool
    created_at: datetime
    last_used: datetime
    usage_count: int
```

**Cache invalidation strategy:**
- Keep questions used in last 30 days
- Prioritize expert-reviewed questions
- Remove low-quality (<70) questions after 7 days
- Update questions if underlying content changes

### Cost Optimization Summary

| Strategy | Cost per Question | Time | Quality |
|----------|-------------------|------|---------|
| On-demand (no cache) | $0.008 | 10-12s | 75-80% |
| On-demand (with prompt cache) | $0.004 | 10-12s | 75-80% |
| Batch API | $0.004 | 3-6s | 75-80% |
| Batch API + prompt cache | $0.002 | 3-6s | 75-80% |
| Database cache (hit) | $0.000 | <1s | 80-90% (reviewed) |

**Recommended for MVP:**
- On-demand generation with prompt caching
- Database caching for frequently-requested topics
- Batch generation for Phase 5 (pre-validated question banks)

## 7. Performance & Cost Estimates

### Generation Time Expectations

Based on Codex CLI performance metrics:

```
Single Question:
├─ Prompt construction: 50ms
├─ RAG retrieval: 200-500ms
├─ GPT-5 generation: 8-15 seconds
├─ JSON parsing: 10ms
└─ Validation: 1-2 seconds
Total: 10-18 seconds per question

5 Questions (batch in prompt):
├─ Prompt construction: 50ms
├─ RAG retrieval: 200-500ms
├─ GPT-5 generation: 30-60 seconds
├─ JSON parsing: 20ms
└─ Validation: 5-10 seconds
Total: 35-70 seconds for 5 questions (7-14s per question)
```

**Optimization opportunities:**
1. **Parallel generation**: Generate 5 questions in parallel (if needed faster)
   - Time: ~15 seconds for 5 questions
   - Cost: 5x (no caching benefit)

2. **Batch in single prompt** (Recommended):
   - Time: 30-60 seconds for 5 questions
   - Cost: 1x (same as single question + extra output tokens)
   - Quality: More consistent difficulty/style across questions

### Cost Breakdown

**Per-Question Costs (5 questions at once):**

```
Input Tokens:
├─ Base prompt template: 500 tokens × $0.00000125 = $0.000625
├─ RAG context (4 chunks): 2,000 tokens × $0.00000125 = $0.0025
├─ Instructions: 300 tokens × $0.00000125 = $0.000375
└─ Total input: 2,800 tokens = $0.0035

Output Tokens (5 questions):
├─ Clinical vignettes: 1,000 tokens × $0.00001 = $0.01
├─ Options: 500 tokens × $0.00001 = $0.005
├─ Explanations: 750 tokens × $0.00001 = $0.0075
├─ JSON structure: 250 tokens × $0.00001 = $0.0025
└─ Total output: 2,500 tokens = $0.025

Total per 5-question generation: $0.0285 (~$0.006 per question)
```

**With Optimizations:**

```
Prompt Caching (90% discount on cached input):
├─ First call: $0.0285
├─ Cached calls: $0.00085 (input) + $0.025 (output) = $0.02585
└─ Effective cost: ~$0.005 per question

Batch API (50% discount):
├─ Input: $0.00175
├─ Output: $0.0125
└─ Total: $0.01425 (~$0.003 per question)

Both optimizations:
└─ ~$0.002 per question
```

**Monthly Cost Estimates:**

| Usage | Questions/Month | Cost (on-demand) | Cost (optimized) |
|-------|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| Light (10 users) | 500 | $3.00 | $1.00 |
| Medium (50 users) | 2,500 | $15.00 | $5.00 |
| Heavy (200 users) | 10,000 | $60.00 | $20.00 |

**Cost is negligible compared to other infrastructure costs.**

### Validation Performance

```
Automated Validation Pipeline:
├─ Structural check: 5ms
├─ Bias detection: 10ms
├─ Medical accuracy (GPT-5): 3-5 seconds
├─ Bloom's classification (GPT-5): 2-3 seconds
└─ Total: 5-8 seconds per question

Cost of validation:
├─ Input (question + prompt): 600 tokens × $0.00000125 = $0.00075
├─ Output (validation result): 200 tokens × $0.00001 = $0.002
└─ Total: ~$0.003 per question

Including validation: ~$0.009 per question (with all optimizations)
```

## 11. Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks & Mitigations

#### 1. Medical Accuracy Risk
**Risk**: AI generates medically incorrect information

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ Automated accuracy validation using second GPT-5 call
- ✅ Confidence scoring on all generated content
- ✅ Human expert review before adding to question bank
- ✅ User reporting mechanism for incorrect questions
- ✅ Regular audit of flagged questions

#### 2. Low-Quality Distractor Risk
**Risk**: Wrong answers are too obvious or implausible

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ Distractor quality scoring in validation
- ✅ Semantic similarity checks (not too different, not too similar)
- ✅ Common misconception database (Phase 5)
- ✅ UMLS integration for clinically-related alternatives (Phase 5)

#### 3. Bias & Fairness Risk
**Risk**: Questions contain demographic bias or stigmatizing language

**Mitigation:**

## Appendix A: Sample Generated Questions

### Example 1: High-Quality Question (Score: 87/100)

**Question:**
A 55-year-old woman with a 20-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus comes to the clinic for routine follow-up. She reports increased thirst and urinary frequency over the past 2 months. Her current medications include metformin 1000 mg twice daily and atorvastatin 20 mg daily. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 78/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 138/85 mm Hg. Laboratory studies show:
- Fasting glucose: 245 mg/dL
- HbA1c: 9.2%
- Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL
- eGFR: 52 mL/min/1.73m²

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

**Options:**
A) Add insulin glargine
B) Add empagliflozin
C) Add pioglitazone
D) Increase metformin to 2000 mg twice daily
E) Add sitagliptin

**Correct Answer:** E) Add sitagliptin

**Explanation:**
This patient has uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (HbA1c 9.2%) with mild chronic kidney disease (CKD stage 3a, eGFR 52). Sitagliptin is the most appropriate choice because:
1. It's safe in CKD with dose adjustment
2. Low hypoglycemia risk
3. Can be added to metformin
4. Well-tolerated

Why other options are incorrect:
- A) Insulin is appropriate but typically reserved after oral agents fail
- B) SGLT2 inhibitors (empagliflozin) are less effective with eGFR <60
- C) Pioglitazone can cause fluid retention and is less preferred
- D) Maximum metformin dose is 2000 mg/day, and may need dose reduction with CKD

**Quality Scores:**
- Structure: 10/10
- Medical Accuracy: 9/10
- Clinical Realism: 9/10
- Bloom's Level: 4 (Analyze)
- Distractor Quality: 9/10
- Bias-Free: 10/10
- **Overall: 87/100 - Excellent**

### Example 2: Moderate Quality Question (Score: 72/100)

**Question:**
A 32-year-old man presents to the emergency department with sudden onset chest pain and shortness of breath. He returned from a long international flight 6 hours ago. His pulse is 110/min and blood pressure is 125/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows mild tachypnea. What is the most likely diagnosis?

**Options:**
A) Pulmonary embolism
B) Myocardial infarction
C) Pneumonia
D) Anxiety attack

**Correct Answer:** A) Pulmonary embolism

**Explanation:**
Recent long flight is a risk factor for DVT/PE. Tachycardia and tachypnea support PE diagnosis.

**Quality Scores:**
- Structure: 8/10 (lacks some clinical details)
- Medical Accuracy: 8/10
- Clinical Realism: 7/10 (too straightforward)
- Bloom's Level: 3 (Apply)
- Distractor Quality: 6/10 (D is too obviously wrong)
- Bias-Free: 10/10
- **Overall: 72/100 - High Quality, needs minor edits**

**Improvements Needed:**
1. Add more vital signs (O2 saturation, respiratory rate)
2. Include physical exam findings (leg swelling?)
3. Add lab results (D-dimer, troponin) to increase realism
4. Replace "anxiety attack" with better distractor (e.g., "pneumothorax")
5. Expand explanation with pathophysiology
