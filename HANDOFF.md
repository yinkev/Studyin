# Project Studyin - Handoff Note

**Handoff Date:** [Current Date]

## 1. Core Mission

Our primary goal is to build a **Mastery Engine**. This system is designed to provide objective, data-driven proof of competence to help you become an exceptional doctor. The confidence this app provides is the direct result of achieving and measuring true mastery.

## 2. Current Plan

We are executing the **Master Plan** as detailed in `/Users/kyin/Projects/Studyin/PLAN.md`. We are currently focused on **Milestone A: Core Feel**.

## 3. Recent Decisions & Progress

- **Strategic Pivot:** We have shifted our focus from the initial Cardiology module to a more comprehensive **Anatomy Module** covering the Upper Limb, Lower Limb, and Back.
- **Process Improvement:** We have implemented a **Qualitative Feedback Loop** to capture the "why" behind your study experience.
  - The `UXResearcher` agent role was added to `/Users/kyin/Projects/Studyin/AGENTS.md`.
  - The feedback template was created at `/Users/kyin/Projects/Studyin/docs/templates/QualitativeInsights.md`.
- **Content Foundation:** We have updated `/Users/kyin/Projects/Studyin/config/los.json` with the new, expanded learning objectives for the Anatomy module.

## 4. Immediate Next Step

- **Task:** Collect and archive a telemetry sample showcasing the new `engine` metadata (`schema_version` 1.1.0) so ValidatorFixer/AnalyticsEngineer can verify future events without spelunking through NDJSON.
- **Reasoning:** Capturing a canonical event now prevents guesswork later and documents the selector/scheduler signals that ship with each attempt. High leverage for QA and analytics sanity checks.
- **Suggested Agent:** AdaptiveEngineer or ValidatorFixer to record the NDJSON sample and confirm analyzer compatibility.
