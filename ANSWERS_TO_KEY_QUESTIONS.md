---

### Model Selection Strategy

```python
class ModelRouter:
    def select_model(self, request):
        # Route based on task complexity and volume
        routing_map = {
            # High complexity → Claude
            "socratic_teaching": ModelType.CLAUDE_35_SONNET,
            "medical_reasoning": ModelType.CLAUDE_35_SONNET,
            "adaptive_teaching": ModelType.CLAUDE_35_SONNET,

            # Medium complexity → GPT-4o-mini
            "mcq_generation": ModelType.GPT_4O_MINI,
            "simple_explanation": ModelType.GPT_4O_MINI,
            "mnemonic_generation": ModelType.GPT_4O_MINI,

            # Bulk processing → Gemini
            "bulk_analysis": ModelType.GEMINI_15_FLASH,
            "document_processing": ModelType.GEMINI_15_FLASH,
        }
        return routing_map.get(request.task_type, ModelType.CLAUDE_35_SONNET)
```

---

## 2. RAG Architecture for Uploaded Materials

### Vector Database Choice: **Qdrant**

**Why Qdrant:**
- ✅ Self-hostable → Cost control (no per-query fees)
- ✅ Fast for <1M vectors (perfect for personal MVP)
- ✅ Built-in filtering by metadata (topic, difficulty, chapter)
- ✅ Hybrid search (vector + keyword)
- ✅ Easy to use with Python
- ✅ Docker deployment in minutes

**Alternative for Ultra-MVP:** PostgreSQL + pgvector
- Zero additional infrastructure
- Good for <100K vectors
- Easy migration to dedicated vector DB later

**Setup:**
```python
retriever = RAGRetriever({
    "url": "localhost",
    "port": 6333,
    "collection": "medical_knowledge",
    "use_reranking": True
})
```

---

### Chunking Strategy: **Hierarchical + Semantic Hybrid**

**Why Hybrid:**
Medical content has structure (chapters, sections) AND semantic meaning. You need both.

**Approach:**
```python
1. Hierarchical Layer (Preserve Structure)
   - Chapter boundaries maintained
   - Section headings preserved
   - Parent-child relationships tracked

   Example:
   Chapter: "Cardiology" (parent)
     ├─ Section: "Heart Failure" (child)
     ├─ Subsection: "Pathophysiology" (grandchild)

2. Semantic Layer (Meaning-Based)
   - Split at natural concept boundaries
   - Keep related sentences together
   - Preserve clinical correlations

   Example:
   "Myocardial infarction occurs when..." [complete concept]
   "Risk factors include hypertension..." [new concept]
```

**Configuration:**
```python
CHUNKING_CONFIG = {
    "strategy": "hybrid",
    "chunk_size": 512,          # tokens
    "overlap": 128,              # preserve context
    "preserve_structure": True,  # keep hierarchy
    "semantic_boundaries": True  # respect meaning
}
```

**Why These Numbers:**
- 512 tokens = ~2-3 paragraphs = complete concept
- 128 token overlap = prevents cutting mid-concept
- Fits in context window with room for multiple chunks

---

### Retrieval Approach: **Hybrid Search + Reranking**

**3-Stage Retrieval Pipeline:**

```python
# Stage 1: Hybrid Vector + Keyword Search
results = await retriever.retrieve(
    query="What causes heart failure?",
    top_k=20,  # Cast wide net
    use_hybrid=True  # Vector + BM25 keyword matching
)

# Stage 2: Reranking for Relevance
# Rerank top 20 → top 5 most relevant
reranked = reranker.rerank(query, results, top_k=5)

# Stage 3: Context Assembly
# Format for LLM with source attribution
context = format_context(reranked)
```

**Why This Works:**
1. **Hybrid search** catches both semantic similarity AND exact keyword matches
2. **Reranking** improves precision (correct results in top positions)
3. **Top-k=20→5** balances recall vs. relevance

---

### Embedding Model: **OpenAI text-embedding-3-small**

**Why:**
- ✅ Best quality-to-cost ratio: $0.02 per 1M tokens
- ✅ 1536 dimensions (good semantic understanding)
- ✅ Outperforms most open-source models
- ✅ Fast API
- ✅ No infrastructure to manage

**Alternative (Self-Hosted):** BGE-large-en-v1.5
- Free (run locally)
- 1024 dimensions
- Good medical domain performance
- Requires GPU for speed

**Cost Comparison:**
```
Processing 1000 pages:
- OpenAI embedding: ~$0.05
- Self-hosted: Free (but electricity + GPU)

For MVP: OpenAI is worth it for simplicity
```

## 3. Prompt Engineering Patterns for Medical Content

### Pattern 1: Structured Output with Medical Validation

```python
MEDICAL_CONCEPT_EXTRACTION = """
Analyze this medical content and extract concepts in JSON:

{content}

Required output structure:
{
    "concepts": [
        {
            "name": "Myocardial Infarction",
            "definition": "...",
            "clinical_significance": "...",
            "usmle_relevance": "High-yield for Step 1",
            "difficulty": 4
        }
    ],
    "clinical_correlations": [...],
    "high_yield_facts": [...],
    "common_misconceptions": [...]
}

Validation rules:
- All information must be medically accurate
- Include clinical relevance for USMLE Step 1
- Flag any outdated information
- Note if information conflicts with current guidelines
"""
```

**Why This Works:**
- Structured JSON → Easy to parse and store
- Medical validation built into prompt
- Clinical focus keeps content USMLE-relevant
- Difficulty rating enables adaptive learning

---

### Pattern 2: Adaptive Teaching with Context

```python
ADAPTIVE_TEACHING_TEMPLATE = """
You are an expert medical educator for USMLE Step 1.

Student Context:
- Level: {user_level}/5 (1=beginner, 5=expert)
- Learning style: {learning_style}
- Recent errors: {recent_mistakes}
- Previous conversation: {context}

Topic: {concept}

Your task:
1. Assess their current understanding from context
2. Explain at THEIR level (not too simple, not too complex)
3. Use their learning style (visual/clinical/analytical)
4. Address their specific misconceptions
5. Use Socratic questions to engage critical thinking
6. Provide clinical examples they can relate to

Structure:
1. Hook (clinical scenario)
2. Core explanation (at their level)
3. Clinical application
4. Memory aid (appropriate to learning style)
5. Active recall questions
6. Common pitfalls

Adapt your explanation based on their responses.
"""
```

**Key Features:**
- Personalization based on user profile
- Error-aware teaching (addresses misconceptions)
- Multi-modal approach (different learning styles)
- Socratic method for active learning
- Clinical integration throughout

---

### Pattern 3: NBME-Style Question Generation

```python
NBME_QUESTION_GENERATION = """
Generate a USMLE Step 1 clinical vignette question.

Parameters:
- Topic: {topic}
- Difficulty: {difficulty}/5
- Test objective: {concept}

NBME Style Requirements:
1. Clinical vignette (2-4 sentences)
   - Patient demographics
   - Chief complaint
   - Relevant findings
   - Lab/imaging if applicable

2. Clear question stem
   - "What is the most likely diagnosis?"
   - "Which mechanism best explains?"
   - "What is the next best step?"

3. Five answer choices (A-E)
   - One clearly correct answer
   - Four plausible distractors
   - Distractors based on common errors:
     * Related but incorrect diagnoses
     * Correct for different scenario
     * Common misconceptions
     * Partially correct but not best

4. Detailed explanations
   - Why correct answer is right (mechanism)
   - Why each distractor is wrong
   - High-yield teaching points
   - Clinical pearls

Reference material for accuracy:
{rag_context}

Output as JSON with all fields.
"""
```

**What Makes This Effective:**
- NBME-specific formatting (matches real exam)
- Intelligent distractors (not random wrong answers)
- Educational value beyond the question
- RAG context ensures medical accuracy
- Structured output for consistency

---

### Pattern 4: Error Pattern Analysis

```python
PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS = """
Analyze this student's question history:

{question_history}

Identify patterns in errors:

1. Knowledge Gaps
   - Which topics show consistent errors?
   - What prerequisite knowledge is missing?
   - Severity of each gap (critical/moderate/minor)

2. Error Patterns
   - Conceptual misunderstandings
   - Test-taking errors (rushing, overthinking)
   - Similar-sounding concepts confused
   - Memorization vs. understanding issues

3. Root Cause Analysis
   - Why are they making these mistakes?
   - What's the underlying misconception?
   - Is it knowledge gap or application problem?

4. Targeted Recommendations
   - Specific topics to review
   - Study methods for their learning style
   - Practice question focus areas
   - Time management advice

Output as structured JSON with actionable insights.
"""
```

**Benefits:**
- Data-driven insights (not just "study more")
- Root cause analysis (fixes underlying issues)
- Personalized recommendations
- Tracks improvement over time

## 4. Context Management Across Sessions

### Three-Layer Memory Architecture

```python
class ContextManager:
    def __init__(self):
        # Layer 1: Short-term (Current session)
        self.short_term = []  # Last 10 interactions
        # Storage: Redis (fast access)

        # Layer 2: Long-term (User profile)
        self.long_term = {
            "completed_topics": [],
            "strengths": [],
            "weaknesses": [],
            "error_patterns": [],
            "learning_style": "clinical"
        }
        # Storage: PostgreSQL (persistent)

        # Layer 3: Episodic (Learning milestones)
        self.episodic = [
            {"date": "2025-01-15", "milestone": "Mastered Cardiology"},
            {"date": "2025-01-20", "milestone": "Completed 100 questions"}
        ]
        # Storage: PostgreSQL (historical)
```

**How It Works:**

```python
def get_context_for_prompt(user_id, session_id):
    # Get relevant context from all layers
    context = {
        # Recent conversation (short-term)
        "recent_interactions": get_last_n(session_id, n=3),

        # User characteristics (long-term)
        "user_profile": {
            "level": user.level,
            "learning_style": user.learning_style,
            "weaknesses": user.weaknesses[-5:],  # Recent weaknesses
            "error_patterns": user.error_patterns[-3:]
        },

        # Learning journey (episodic)
        "progress": {
            "topics_mastered": user.completed_topics,
            "recent_milestones": user.episodic_memory[-3:]
        }
    }

    # Compress to fit in context window
    compressed = compress_context(context, max_tokens=2000)

    return compressed
```

---

### Context Compression Strategy

```python
def compress_context(history, max_tokens=2000):
    """Keep recent detail, summarize older content"""

    # Keep full context for last 3 interactions
    recent = history[-3:]  # ~1000 tokens

    # Summarize older interactions
    if len(history) > 3:
        older = history[:-3]

        # Use LLM to summarize (with cheap model)
        summary = llm.summarize(
            older,
            format="bullet_points",
            max_length=500  # tokens
        )

        return f"Previous session summary:\n{summary}\n\n" + \
               f"Recent conversation:\n{format(recent)}"

    return format(recent)
```

**Why This Works:**
- Recent context stays detailed (most relevant)
- Older context compressed (save tokens)
- User profile provides continuity across sessions
- Total tokens stay under limit

---

### Session Continuity

```python
# Start new session with context from previous
def resume_learning(user_id):
    # Get last session
    last_session = db.get_last_session(user_id)

    # Create continuation prompt
    prompt = f"""
    Welcome back! Last session:
    - You were studying: {last_session.topics}
    - You completed: {last_session.questions_answered} questions
    - Accuracy: {last_session.accuracy}%
    - We identified you need more work on: {last_session.weak_areas}

    Let's continue from where we left off.
    """

    return prompt
```

## 5. Adaptive Learning Path Generation

### Algorithm Overview

```python
class AdaptiveLearningPathGenerator:
    def generate_path(self, user_profile):
        # Step 1: Knowledge Graph Analysis
        knowledge_graph = self.build_knowledge_graph(user_profile)
        gaps = self.identify_gaps(knowledge_graph)

        # Step 2: Dependency Resolution
        # Can't learn "heart failure" before "cardiac physiology"
        ordered_topics = self.topological_sort(gaps)

        # Step 3: Personalization
        # Adjust for learning style and preferences
        personalized = self.apply_learning_style(
            ordered_topics,
            user_profile.learning_style
        )

        # Step 4: Spaced Repetition Integration
        # Schedule reviews at optimal intervals
        with_review = self.add_spaced_repetition(
            personalized,
            intervals=[1, 3, 7, 14, 30]  # days
        )

        # Step 5: Difficulty Ramping
        # Gradually increase difficulty
        final_path = self.add_difficulty_progression(with_review)

        return final_path
```

---

### Real-Time Difficulty Adjustment

```python
class DifficultyAdapter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.target_accuracy = 0.75  # Sweet spot for learning
        self.window_size = 5  # questions to consider

    def adjust_difficulty(self, recent_performance):
        """
        Adjust difficulty to maintain optimal challenge
        Goal: 70-80% accuracy (hard enough to learn, not frustrating)
        """

        # Calculate recent accuracy
        recent_questions = recent_performance[-self.window_size:]
        accuracy = sum(q['correct'] for q in recent_questions) / len(recent_questions)

        current_difficulty = self.current_difficulty

        # Adjustment logic
        if accuracy > 0.85:
            # Too easy → increase difficulty
            new_difficulty = min(5, current_difficulty + 1)
            reason = "Performing well, increasing challenge"

        elif accuracy < 0.60:
            # Too hard → decrease difficulty
            new_difficulty = max(1, current_difficulty - 1)
            reason = "Struggling, providing more support"

        else:
            # Optimal range → maintain
            new_difficulty = current_difficulty
            reason = "Optimal challenge level maintained"

        # Safety check: Don't adjust too quickly
        if self.questions_at_current_difficulty < 5:
            return current_difficulty  # Need more data

        return {
            "new_difficulty": new_difficulty,
            "reason": reason,
            "expected_accuracy": self.predict_accuracy(new_difficulty)
        }
```

---

### Spaced Repetition Integration

```python
def schedule_review(topic, initial_learning_date):
    """
    Ebbinghaus forgetting curve-based scheduling
    """
    intervals = [
        1,   # Day 1 (review tomorrow)
        3,   # Day 4 (review in 3 days)
        7,   # Day 11 (review in 1 week)
        14,  # Day 25 (review in 2 weeks)
        30   # Day 55 (review in 1 month)
    ]

    reviews = []
    for i, interval in enumerate(intervals):
        review_date = initial_learning_date + timedelta(days=interval)
        reviews.append({
            "review_number": i + 1,
            "date": review_date,
            "topic": topic,
            "estimated_retention": calculate_retention(interval),
            "priority": "high" if i < 2 else "medium"
        })

    return reviews
```

## 6. Cost Optimization Strategies

### Strategy 1: Semantic Caching (60% Cost Reduction)

```python
# Similar questions get cached responses
cache = AdvancedSemanticCache(
    similarity_threshold=0.92  # 92% similar → use cache
)

# Example:
query1 = "What causes myocardial infarction?"
query2 = "What are the causes of heart attack?"
# 95% similar → cache hit! No API call needed

# Savings:
# - First question: $0.015 (API call)
# - Second question: $0.000 (cached)
# - Reduction: 100% for similar queries
```

**Expected Impact:**
- 60% of questions are variations of common queries
- Cache hit rate: 60-70% after initial use
- Monthly savings: ~$120 for 100 questions/day

---

### Strategy 2: Model Routing (30% Cost Reduction)

```python
# Route tasks to appropriate models
def route_request(task):
    cost_map = {
        "claude-3.5-sonnet": 0.015,  # per request
        "gpt-4o-mini": 0.003,        # 80% cheaper
        "gemini-1.5-flash": 0.001    # 93% cheaper
    }

    # Simple task → cheap model
    if task.complexity == "simple":
        return "gpt-4o-mini"  # Save $0.012/request

    # Bulk processing → cheapest model
    if task.type == "bulk":
        return "gemini-1.5-flash"  # Save $0.014/request

    # Complex reasoning → best model
    return "claude-3.5-sonnet"

# Result:
# - 40% of tasks use cheap models
# - Average cost: $0.009 (vs $0.015 all Claude)
# - Savings: 40%
```

---

### Strategy 3: Request Batching (20% Efficiency Gain)

```python
class RequestBatcher:
    """Batch similar requests"""

    async def batch_questions(self, topics):
        # Instead of 10 separate API calls
        # Generate 10 questions in ONE call

        prompt = f"""
        Generate 10 USMLE questions covering:
        {topics}

        Return as JSON array.
        """

        # One API call instead of 10
        # Cost: $0.025 vs $0.150
        # Savings: 83%
```

---

### Strategy 4: Response Streaming (Better UX, Same Cost)

```python
# Stream responses for immediate feedback
async def stream_response(prompt):
    stream = await llm.stream(prompt)

    # User sees response immediately (better UX)
    # Can stop early if needed (save tokens)
    async for chunk in stream:
        yield chunk

        if user_satisfied():
            stream.cancel()  # Stop generating, save money
            break
```

---

### Cost Monitoring Dashboard

```python
# Real-time cost tracking
async def get_cost_report():
    return {
        "today": {
            "spent": "$2.35",
            "budget": "$10.00",
            "remaining": "$7.65",
            "requests": 287,
            "cached": 172,
            "api_calls": 115,
            "cache_hit_rate": "60%"
        },
        "this_month": {
            "spent": "$45.20",
            "projected": "$67.50",
            "budget": "$300.00"
        },
        "recommendations": [
            "Cache hit rate is good (60%)",
            "Consider increasing cache TTL for FAQ questions",
            "Most expensive model: Claude (70% of costs)"
        ]
    }
```

## 7. Fallback Strategies

### Multi-Tier Fallback System

```python
class FallbackManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.providers = [
            {
                "name": "claude",
                "priority": 1,
                "rate_limit": 50,
                "current_usage": 0
            },
            {
                "name": "openai",
                "priority": 2,
                "rate_limit": 500,
                "current_usage": 0
            },
            {
                "name": "gemini",
                "priority": 3,
                "rate_limit": 1000,
                "current_usage": 0
            }
        ]

    async def execute_with_fallback(self, request):
        """Try providers in order until success"""

        for provider in self.providers:
            try:
                # Check rate limit
                if provider['current_usage'] < provider['rate_limit']:
                    response = await self.call_provider(provider, request)
                    return response

            except RateLimitError:
                logger.warning(f"{provider['name']} rate limited, trying next")
                continue

            except APIError as e:
                logger.error(f"{provider['name']} failed: {e}")
                continue

        return self.get_degraded_response(request)
```

### Graceful Degradation Levels

```python
def get_degraded_response(request):
    """Provide useful response even when APIs fail"""

    # Level 1: Check semantic cache for similar question
    cached = semantic_cache.find_similar(request.prompt, threshold=0.85)
    if cached:
        return cached  # Close enough

    # Level 2: Return pre-generated content
    if request.type == "mcq_generation":
        return get_pregenerated_question(request.topic)

    # Level 3: Queue for async processing
    queue.add(request)
    return {
        "message": "High demand. Your question is queued.",
        "estimated_wait": "2 minutes",
        "queue_position": queue.position(request)
    }

    # Level 4: Basic fallback message
    return {
        "message": "Service temporarily unavailable. Please try again.",
        "alternative": "Review your study materials while we recover."
    }
```

### Circuit Breaker Pattern

```python
class CircuitBreaker:
    """Prevent cascade failures"""

    def __init__(self, failure_threshold=5, timeout=60):
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.timeout = timeout
        self.state = "CLOSED"  # CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN
        self.last_failure_time = None

    async def call(self, func, *args):
        if self.state == "OPEN":
            if time.time() - self.last_failure_time > self.timeout:
                self.state = "HALF_OPEN"  # Try again
            else:
                raise CircuitOpenError("Circuit breaker is OPEN")

        try:
            result = await func(*args)
            self.on_success()
            return result

        except Exception as e:
            self.on_failure()
            raise

    def on_failure(self):
        self.failure_count += 1
        self.last_failure_time = time.time()

        if self.failure_count >= self.failure_threshold:
            self.state = "OPEN"
            logger.error("Circuit breaker opened due to failures")

    def on_success(self):
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.state = "CLOSED"
```

## Cost Projections Summary

### Conservative Estimate (100 questions/day)

```
WITHOUT Optimization:
- 100 questions × $0.015 (Claude) = $1.50/day
- Monthly: $45

WITH Full Optimization:
- Cache hit rate: 60% → 60 cached (free)
- 40 API calls needed
  - 20 simple (GPT-4o-mini): 20 × $0.003 = $0.06
  - 20 complex (Claude): 20 × $0.015 = $0.30
- Daily cost: $0.36
- Monthly: $10.80

SAVINGS: 76% reduction ($45 → $10.80)
```

### Breakdown by Feature

```
MCQ Generation: $3/month (GPT-4o-mini)
Teaching/Explanations: $5/month (Claude)
Performance Analysis: $1/month (Claude, infrequent)
Document Processing: $1/month (Gemini, one-time)
Embeddings: $0.80/month (OpenAI)

Total: ~$11/month for heavy use
```

## Monitoring & Success Metrics

### Key Metrics to Track

```python
metrics = {
    # Quality
    "user_satisfaction": 4.5,  # out of 5
    "question_accuracy": 0.75,  # target accuracy maintained

    # Performance
    "avg_response_time": "1.2s",
    "cache_hit_rate": "68%",

    # Cost
    "daily_spend": "$0.38",
    "cost_per_question": "$0.004",

    # Engagement
    "questions_per_session": 25,
    "session_completion_rate": "87%",
    "weekly_active_users": 1
}
```

## Final Recommendations

### For Your MVP:

1. **Start Simple:**
   - Use Claude 3.5 Sonnet for everything initially
   - Add GPT-4o-mini routing after validating quality
   - Implement caching from day 1

2. **Focus on Value:**
   - Get MCQ generation working first
   - Add adaptive teaching second
   - Analytics and optimization can wait

3. **Monitor Costs:**
   - Set daily budget alerts ($2/day initially)
   - Review optimization report weekly
   - Adjust routing as you learn usage patterns

4. **Iterate Based on Data:**
   - Track which features users love
   - Optimize expensive operations
   - Add features based on actual need

### Expected Outcomes:

- **Month 1:** $20-30 in API costs (learning phase)
- **Month 2:** $10-15 (optimization kicks in)
- **Month 3+:** $5-10 (stable, optimized usage)

**ROI:** Even at $30/month, this beats any commercial USMLE prep service ($300-500)!
