    "Remember the lateral-to-medial sequence (Scaphoid to Pisiform, Trapezium to Hamate) because it drives palpation and injury localization.",
    "Capitate sits central and anchors the wrist axis—mention this before discussing midcarpal motion.",
    "Hook of the hamate is a frequent compression site (ulnar nerve/artery) to flag for clinical translation."

  "pitfalls": [
    "Learners often swap trapezium and trapezoid—highlight thumb alignment to prevent this.",
    "Pisiform is sesamoid; emphasize it rides volar to the triquetrum so it is not mis-labeled as a carpal partner."
