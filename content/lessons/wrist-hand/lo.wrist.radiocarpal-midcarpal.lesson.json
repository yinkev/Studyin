  "title": "Radiocarpal vs. Midcarpal Motion",
  "summary": "Contrast the proximal radiocarpal condylar joint with the plane-like midcarpal joints, tying each to the arcs of flexion-extension and radial-ulnar deviation.",
  "high_yield": [
    "Radiocarpal joint primarily handles flexion-extension initiation and absorbs 80% of axial load.",
    "Midcarpal joint fine-tunes radial/ulnar deviation—show the alternating concave/convex surfaces.",
    "Mention closed-packed positions (extension + radial deviation) for stability questions."
  ],
  "pitfalls": [
    "Students blur the two joint contributions; use dual gauges showing % contribution to motion arcs.",
    "Avoid calling midcarpal joints hinge—reiterate plane/gliding nature."
