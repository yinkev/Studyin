  "stem": "A rock climber notices reduced grip strength when using a power grip (metacarpophalangeal flexion with interphalangeal extension). Examination shows weakness of interossei and lumbricals to digits 4 and 5, while wrist flexion with ulnar deviation is preserved. Which nerve branch is responsible for the weak power grip?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "Deep branch of the ulnar nerve",
    "B": "Anterior interosseous nerve",

    "E": "Superficial branch of the ulnar nerve"

  "key": "A",
  "rationale_correct": "Power grip depends on the intrinsic hand muscles (interossei, lumbricals) supplied by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve; weakness indicates its dysfunction.",
  "rationale_distractors": {
    "B": "The anterior interosseous nerve controls deep flexors of digits 1â€“3, not interossei.",
    "C": "The recurrent median branch innervates thenar muscles for thumb opposition.",
    "D": "Posterior interosseous nerve controls finger extensors, not intrinsic flexion.",
    "E": "The superficial ulnar branch is sensory, not motor."
