Sensation is reduced over the posterior arm and forearm. Where is the most likely site of radial nerve injury?",

  "rationale_correct": "Combined triceps weakness with sensory loss over posterior arm/forearm indicates a high radial nerve injury in the axilla/triangular interval, proximal to branches to the triceps and cutaneous nerves.",
  "rationale_distractors": {
    "B": "Posterior interosseous lesions cause motor deficits distal to the elbow without sensory loss or triceps weakness.",
    "C": "Radial tunnel syndrome spares triceps and cutaneous branches, causing pain more than sensory loss.",
    "D": "Superficial radial lesions produce isolated dorsal hand sensory changes without motor deficits.",
    "E": "Spiral groove injuries typically spare triceps strength because branches to the long head depart proximally."
