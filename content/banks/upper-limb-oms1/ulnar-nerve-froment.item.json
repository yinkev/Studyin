  "rationale_distractors": {
    "B": "Flexor pollicis longus flexes the thumb IP joint and is median innervated; it overacts rather than weakens.",
    "C": "Abductor pollicis brevis is median innervated and affects thumb abduction, not adduction grip strength.",
    "D": "Extensor pollicis longus extends the thumb; dysfunction would prevent extension, not cause Froment sign.",
    "E": "Opponens pollicis controls thumb opposition and is median innervated."
