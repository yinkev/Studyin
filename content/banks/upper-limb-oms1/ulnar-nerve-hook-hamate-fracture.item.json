  "rationale_distractors": {
    "B": "Superficial sensory injury would impair medial palm sensation without significant motor loss.",
    "C": "The dorsal cutaneous branch leaves proximal to the wrist; damage would reduce dorsal sensation, which is intact here.",
    "D": "The medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve supplies forearm sensation rather than intrinsic hand muscles.",
    "E": "Posterior interosseous nerve lesions cause finger extension weakness and spare ulnar-innervated interossei."
