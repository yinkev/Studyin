### RAG Architecture

```
Document → Chunking (Hybrid) → Embeddings → Qdrant
                                                ↓
User Query → Embedding → Hybrid Search → Rerank → Context
                                                ↓
                                         LLM + Context → Response
```

**Key Features:**
- Hierarchical + semantic chunking (512 tokens, 128 overlap)
- Hybrid search (vector + keyword BM25)
- Reranking for precision
- Adaptive retrieval based on user level

## 🎓 Key Features

### 1. Adaptive Difficulty

```python
# Automatically adjusts to maintain 70-80% accuracy
if accuracy > 85%:
    difficulty += 1  # Too easy
elif accuracy < 60%:
    difficulty -= 1  # Too hard
# Optimal learning zone
```

### 2. Intelligent Model Routing

```python
# Route tasks to optimal models
simple_task → GPT-4o-mini ($0.003)   # 80% cheaper
complex_task → Claude 3.5 ($0.015)    # Best quality
bulk_task → Gemini Flash ($0.001)     # Cheapest
```

### 3. Semantic Caching

```python
# Similar questions get cached responses
query1 = "What causes MI?"
query2 = "What are causes of heart attack?"
# 95% similar → cache hit! No API call
# Savings: 60-70% of requests
```

### 4. Context Management

```python
# Three-layer memory system
short_term:  Last 10 interactions (Redis)
long_term:   User profile & history (PostgreSQL)
episodic:    Learning milestones (PostgreSQL)
```

### 5. Medical-Specific Features
