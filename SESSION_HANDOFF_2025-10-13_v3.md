# Session Handoff Document v3

Date: 2025-10-13 (Session 3)
Focus: Chat UI component migration to shadcn/ui + Playwright E2E scaffold
Status: In progress — UI controls migrated; E2E smoke added

---

## 1) What changed this session

### Chat controls migrated to components (shadcn/ui)
- Added `frontend/src/components/chat/ChatControls.tsx` that wraps:
  - Learning Mode (Select)
  - Verbosity (Select)
  - Reasoning (Select)
  - Level (native range for now)
- Integrated `ChatControls` into `ChatPanel` and preserved existing handlers:
  - `onLevel`, `onProfile`, `onVerbosity`, `onEffort`, `onReconnect`
- Added stable `data-testid` attributes for Playwright MCP:
  - `select-learning-mode`, `select-verbosity`, `select-effort`, `slider-level`, `chat-panel`

Files:
- NEW: `frontend/src/components/chat/ChatControls.tsx`
- MOD: `frontend/src/components/chat/ChatPanel.tsx`

### Playwright E2E (smoke) added
- NEW config: `frontend/playwright.config.ts` (baseURL `http://localhost:5173`, trace on first retry)
- NEW test: `frontend/e2e/chat-ui.spec.ts` (navigates to Chat, asserts control presence, basic interaction)
- NPM script: `"e2e": "playwright test"`

Files:
- NEW: `frontend/playwright.config.ts`
- NEW: `frontend/e2e/chat-ui.spec.ts`
- MOD: `frontend/package.json` (scripts)

---

## 2) Current results

- Frontend reachable at http://localhost:5173 (verified).
- Initial E2E run executed; current smoke fails waiting for Chat controls on CI runner machine.
  - Likely cause: lazy route not settled or text selector mismatch; we added explicit waits and testids.
  - Next run should stabilize once dev server reloads the updated components (works locally in manual checks).

Artifacts: `frontend/playwright-report/` (HTML), plus screenshots/videos under `frontend/test-results/` after a run.

---

## 3) How to run

Start services (as per prior handoff):
```
./START_SERVERS.sh
```

Run E2E smoke:
```
cd frontend
npm run e2e
# Open HTML report
npx playwright show-report
```

If you see dependency conflicts on install, use legacy peer deps (we already handled this in-session):
```
npm i -D @playwright/test --legacy-peer-deps
npx playwright install
```

---

## 4) Agent workflow used

- ui-ux-designer: Define control layout/a11y, token usage, tooltip copy
- frontend-developer: Implement `ChatControls` + wire into `ChatPanel`
- test-automator: Add Playwright config + smoke spec with stable selectors
- backend-architect (advisory): Confirm WS `/api/chat/ws` contract unchanged; CORS/Origin OK

Notes:
- We deliberately kept Level as a native `range` for speed. Next, consider adding a Radix-wrapped `ui/slider` for full parity.

---

## 5) Risks and mitigations

- Portal/layering (Radix): Select menus render in a portal. We used shadcn defaults; no z-index issues observed.
- Mixed styles: Controls now use components; message bubbles still use custom CSS. Plan a phase-2 to move bubbles to `Card` + utilities.
- E2E flake: Added `data-testid` + longer waits; if still flaky, assert by labels or placeholder and increase timeouts.

---

## 6) Next steps

Priority A — stabilize E2E smoke
- [ ] Ensure dev server picked up latest changes; rerun `npm run e2e`
- [ ] Switch textarea wait to `getByRole('textbox')` if placeholder differs across locales
- [ ] Add `await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle')` after nav click

Priority B — polish Chat UI
- [ ] Replace native range with `ui/slider` wrapper (Radix Slider)
- [ ] Convert error/reconnect banners to `ui/alert` + `Button`
- [ ] Reduce remaining `.chat-*` CSS blocks (index.css)

Priority C — expand E2E coverage
- [ ] Upload page input presence + disabled state when offline
- [ ] Analytics header + Refresh flow
- [ ] Optional: basic message send if WS is up

---

## 7) References (updated docs used)
- shadcn/ui + Tailwind v4 guidance: components on Tailwind v4, `@theme`, CSS vars
- Radix Slider anatomy (for future `ui/slider` wrapper)
- Playwright best practices (baseURL, role-first locators, testids)

---

Ready for the next developer. Ping me if you want me to proceed with Phase B (message container refactor) and add a `ui/slider` wrapper.
